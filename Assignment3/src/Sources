Used dataset's from https://www.kaggle.com/

To generate dates we used a variation of this command in excel:
=RANDBETWEEN(DATE(year, month, day),DATE(year, month, day))

To generate some string values such as names, production companies, roleNames, etc., we used a variation of this command in excel:
=CHOOSE(RANDBETWEEN(1,3),"Value1","Value2","Value3")
